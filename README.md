# FreedomSearch
A custom, self-hosted search engine to help find websites on the internet,
all without leaving your local network.

## Why?
I've found that a lot of the available search engines that already exist
have issues where irrelevant data tends to get in the way, or the ordering
of results requires deeper digging and scrolling to get to the content actually
desired.
